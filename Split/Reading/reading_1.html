    <h1>Reading Practice</h1>
    
    <p><sup>1</sup>In a small village, nestled between rolling hills, there lived a curious boy named Tom. <sup>2</sup>Tom had a knack for finding hidden treasures in the most unexpected places. <sup>3</sup>One sunny afternoon, he ventured into the woods behind his house, following a trail of sparkling stones.</p>
    <p><sup>4</sup>As he walked deeper into the forest, the trees grew taller and the sunlight dimmer. <sup>5</sup>Suddenly, he stumbled upon a small, ancient-looking chest buried halfway in the ground.</p>
    <p><sup>6</sup>With great effort, Tom pulled the chest out and opened it, revealing a collection of old, dusty books. <sup>7</sup>To his surprise, one of the books had his name inscribed on its cover. <sup>8</sup>Curious, he opened the book and found it filled with tales of adventure, each story strangely familiar.</p>
    <p><sup>9</sup>Tom realized that the book was recounting his own dreams and imaginings. <sup>10</sup>Every page he turned unveiled a new chapter of his life, adventures he had yet to embark upon. <sup>11</sup>Excited and a bit overwhelmed, he ran home to show his parents his newfound treasure.</p>
