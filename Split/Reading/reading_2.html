    <h1>Reading Practice Passage</h1>
    <p><sup>1</sup>In the early days of space exploration, scientists faced numerous challenges in their quest to understand the mysteries of the universe. <sup>2</sup>One of the most significant achievements was the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope, which has provided unprecedented views of distant galaxies and contributed to our understanding of the cosmos.</p>
    <p><sup>3</sup>Before the Hubble, our observations from Earth were limited by atmospheric distortion and light pollution. <sup>4</sup>The Hubble Space Telescope, positioned above Earth's atmosphere, has given astronomers the ability to capture clearer and more detailed images.</p>
    <p><sup>5</sup>Since its launch, the Hubble has captured images of star formation, planetary systems, and other celestial phenomena. <sup>6</sup>These images have not only been scientifically valuable but have also inspired awe and fascination among the general public.</p>
    <p><sup>7</sup>The Hubble's observations have led to groundbreaking discoveries, such as measurements of the rate of the universe's expansion and the identification of black holes. <sup>8</sup>Despite its age, the Hubble continues to be a vital tool for astronomers and will remain in service until a more advanced telescope takes its place.</p>
