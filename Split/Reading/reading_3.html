<h1>READING PRACTICE</h1>
<p>Questions 1 – 5:</p><p>This passage is adapted from Jane Austen, "Pride and Prejudice". ©1813 by Jane Austen.</p><p><br/></p><p>(1) It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.<sup>1</sup> However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.<sup>2</sup> "My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"</p>

<p>(2) <sup>3</sup>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</p>
<p>(3) <sup>4</sup>"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."</p>
<p>(4) <sup>5</sup>Mr. Bennet made no answer.</p>
<p>(5) <sup>6</sup>"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.</p>
<p>(6) <sup>7</sup>"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."</p>
<p>(7) <sup>8</sup>This was invitation enough.</p>
<p>(8) <sup>9</sup>"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."</p>
<p>(9) <sup>10</sup>"What is his name?"</p>
<p>(10) <sup>11</sup>"Bingley."</p>
<p>(11) <sup>12</sup>"Is he married or single?"</p>
<p>(12) <sup>13</sup>"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"</p>
<p>(13) <sup>14</sup>"How so? How can it affect them?"</p>
<p>(14) <sup>15</sup>"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."</p>
