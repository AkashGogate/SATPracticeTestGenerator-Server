            <h2>Hacks for SAT Writing & Language</h2>
            <h3>1. Keep It Short</h3>
            <p>The SAT prefers shorter, concise answers. Avoid redundancy and unnecessary wordiness. If an answer choice is unnecessarily long, it's probably wrong.</p>
            <h3>2. Equally Right = Equally Wrong</h3>
            <p>If two answers seem equally correct, they must both be wrong. A multiple-choice question can have only one correct answer.</p>
            <h3>3. Banish “Being”</h3>
            <p>The word “being” is almost always incorrect on the SAT. If you see it in an answer choice, it's likely wrong. Avoid using it.</p>
            <h3>4. Semicolon = Period. Period.</h3>
            <p>On the SAT, a semicolon functions exactly like a period, separating two independent clauses. They are not interchangeable with commas.</p>
            <h3>5. Use Commas (or Dashes) to Bracket Off “Inessential Information”</h3>
            <p>Use commas or dashes to enclose information that can be removed without altering the sentence's structure. Avoid mixing punctuation marks.</p>
            <h3>6. Cut Out the Fat</h3>
            <p>Simplify sentences by removing unnecessary phrases and focusing on the subject. This is especially useful for questions involving singular/plural verbs and pronouns.</p>
            <h3>7. Where Do Main Ideas Go?</h3>
            <p>Main ideas are typically found at the end of the first paragraph, the beginning of each body paragraph, and the end of the passage. Use these locations to find or match main ideas.</p>
            <h3>8. When Merging, Watch Your Lane!</h3>
            <p>Determine how two ideas relate (agreement, contrast, cause/effect, time) and choose the appropriate transition word. Eliminate choices that don’t match the relationship.</p>
            <h3>9. No Means No … If It’s Redundant or Irrelevant</h3>
            <p>For questions about keeping or deleting sentences, always check if the information is redundant or irrelevant. If it is, the answer should be no.</p>
