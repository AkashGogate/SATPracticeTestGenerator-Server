    <h1>WRITING</h1>
    <p>Questions 1 â€“ 5:</p>
    <p>
        Flavored <u>smoothies</u><sup>1</sup> have become exceedingly popular in recent years, with countless variations to suit all tastes. A typical smoothie consists of blended fruit, juice or milk, and sometimes additional ingredients such as yogurt, nuts, and seeds. Smoothies are praised for their potential health benefits and as a convenient way to consume a variety of nutrients. Nutritionists often recommend incorporating a smoothie into one's daily diet as a means of getting essential vitamins and <u>minerals</u><sup>2</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, not all smoothies are created equal. Some store-bought varieties are loaded with sugar and <u>preservatives</u><sup>3</sup>, which can negate any of the potential health benefits. Therefore, it is often better to make your own smoothies at home, where you can control the ingredients and ensure they are fresh and nutritious. Additionally, homemade smoothies can be tailored to individual dietary needs and preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the key advantages of smoothies is their <u>versatility</u><sup>4</sup>. Almost any fruit can be used, and vegetables such as spinach and kale can be added without negatively affecting the taste. For those with dietary restrictions or preferences, smoothies can be made dairy-free, nut-free, or gluten-free with ease. This makes them a widely accessible and customizable choice for a healthy diet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another consideration is the environmental impact. Store-bought smoothies often come in single-use plastic containers, contributing to the growing problem of plastic waste. By making smoothies at home, you can reduce this waste by using reusable containers and purchasing fresh, whole fruits instead of pre-packaged options.
